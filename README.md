# Portfolio
Hello I am Alec Hantson a student AI Engineer(MCT) from Belgium!

In my portfolio you can find all of my technical knowledge about AI.

## Liniar regression
Two little project that helped me gain knowledge and understanding of liniar regression models. I also did some basic data analysis and compared the lasso and ridge regularisators.
### Weight predictor
Simple liniar regression model to predict the weight of a person based on things the person did that week. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_weight_prediction.ipynb)
### Lego price predictor
Predicting the price of a lego set based on features like difficulty and review scores. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_lego_price_prediction.ipynb)

## Logistic regression
With these project I want to show my understanding about working with logistic regression models. Analysis and understanding results.
### Diabetes detector
Model that predicts if a patient has diabetes or not based on medical parameters. I also edited the model to lower the number of flase negatives since we don't want to tell patient they don't have diabetes when they do. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LogisticRegression/Logistic_Regression_Diabetes_Classifier.ipynb)
### HR helper
With this model an HR department could detect if a employee is planning on leaving the company or not. If they are then they can act on it quickly so he will stay. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LogisticRegression/Logistic_Regression_HR_Classifier.ipynb)

## Support Vector Machine
Showing my technical knowledge and understanding of SVM's and optimizing with grid search and random search
### Cancer detection
Compared Logistic regression model with SVM model in detecting cancer based on medical info. [View Code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/Support_Vector_Machines/SVM_Cancer_Detector.ipynb)
