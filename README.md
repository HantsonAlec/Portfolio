# Portfolio
Hello I am Alec Hantson a student AI Engineer(MCT) from Belgium!

In my portfolio you can find all of my demos/projects to show my technical knowledge about AI. All of the code are notebooks to show my thinking and display my knowledge in a clean way.

## Liniar regression
Two little project that helped me gain knowledge and understanding of liniar regression models.

What I learned:
  - How to implement linear regression.
  - Data analysis
  - Using different regularistions and comparing them.

### Weight predictor
Simple liniar regression model to predict the weight of a person based on things the person did that week. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_weight_prediction.ipynb)
### Lego price predictor
Predicting the price of a lego set based on features like difficulty and review scores. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_lego_price_prediction.ipynb)

## Logistic regression
With these project I want to show my understanding about working with logistic regression models. Analysis and understanding results.

What I learned:
  - Using Logistic regression.
  - Data analysis and the impact of unbalanced data.
  - Understanding impact of false negatives in some situations.

### Diabetes detector
Model that predicts if a patient has diabetes or not based on medical parameters. I also edited the model to lower the number of flase negatives since we don't want to tell patient they don't have diabetes when they do. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LogisticRegression/Logistic_Regression_Diabetes_Classifier.ipynb)
### HR helper
With this model an HR department could detect if a employee is planning on leaving the company or not. If they are then they can act on it quickly so he will stay. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LogisticRegression/Logistic_Regression_HR_Classifier.ipynb)

## Support Vector Machine
Showing my technical knowledge and understanding of SVM's and optimizing with grid search and random search.

What I learned:
  - Ins and outs of Support Vector Machines.
  - Using grid search and random search for hyperparameter optimization.
  - Evaluating difference between SVM's and Logistic regression models.
  - Understanding and using PCA.

### Cancer detection
Compared Logistic regression model with SVM model in detecting cancer based on medical info. [View Code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/Support_Vector_Machines/SVM_Cancer_Detector.ipynb)
### Face classifier
Here I created a simple face classifier with the purpose of showing knowledge about PCA. Eigenfaces are used to classify Faces. [View Code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/Support_Vector_Machines/Face%20Detection.ipynb)

## Naive Bayes
NLP model with machine learling instead of deep learning. This shows my technical knowledge of Naive bayes models and a little bit oversampling/augmentation for text.

What I learned:
  - Working with Naive Bayes models.
  - Data oversampling and augmentation.
  - Bag of words principles.

### Cybertrolls classifier
Model that detects if a tweet is from a cybertroll or not. Based on the text and length of the sentence. [View Code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/Naive_Bayes/Naive_Bayes_Cybertrolls.ipynb)

## Unsupervised Learning
Exploring different clustering techniques.

What I learned:
  - Working with different clustering techniques
  - Learning how to find right parameters for clustering like elbow technique.

### Customer clustering
Using supermarket customer data and clustering to find target groups. [View Code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/Unsupervised_Learning/Unsupervised_Learning_Clustering.ipynb)
