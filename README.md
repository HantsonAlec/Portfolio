## Liniar regression
Two little project that helped me gain knowledge and understanding of liniar regression models.
### Weight predictor
Simple liniar regression model to predict the weight of a person based on things the person did that week. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_weight_prediction.ipynb)
### Lego price predictor
Predicting the price of a lego set based on features like difficulty and review scores. [View code](https://github.com/HantsonAlec/Portfolio/blob/main/LinearRegression/Linear_Regression_lego_price_prediction.ipynb)
